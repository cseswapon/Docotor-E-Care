                                Before you start writing, define how your article will help your customers. This will help you stay on topic and only include advice that’s genuinely useful. For example, if you want to help your customers get set up with your product, only include tips that provide value right away - like how to install and customize your app.

                                Share the tips you follow yourself every day. For example, if you have a project management app, write about how you plan your own projects. To do this right, you need to stay up to date with how your features work - so stay tuned in to your product's updates.

                                    Your customers are more familiar with the goal they’re trying to achieve, than the terminology of your product. Your help content should address the jobs your customers want to do, not the features they’re trying to use.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Opening your article with the job it helps customers do, will entice them to read on. For example, ‘Work together to reach your project goal on time’ is far more appealing than ‘Here’s how to use ExampleApp’s team feature.’ Leading with the job in your title, description and sub-headings will let people quickly see if your article can help them achieve what they need.
                                </p>

                                Keep each paragraph short and to the point so you don’t overwhelm your customers with too much information. Their attention will be naturally drawn to your article description and subheadings - so use these to call out your most important points. Adding bullet-points, dividers, tables, screenshots and plenty of whitespace makes it easy for customers to quickly scan your article and find what they need.

                                Rather than making each article perfect before you publish it, go ahead and get it out there. Then learn from your customers' reactions to it and the conversations it sparks. Armed with that feedback, you can keep iterating and improving your content to make it more useful for customers.
